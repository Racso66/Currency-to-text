# Currency-to-text
This code converts Double number value into its Text String form. The text is just like how it is on a cheque.<br /><br />
Enter any double number within the range 0-99,999 after running the code and it will return you with the string
value. <br /><br />
Ex: 99203, "ninety nine" is the value for the thousand part, "two hundred" is the value for the hundred part,
"three" is the value for the ones part. The return value for this will be "ninety nine thousand two hundred and 
three -----------------dollars".
